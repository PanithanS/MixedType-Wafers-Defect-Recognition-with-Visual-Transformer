# Visual transformer for mixed-type wafer defect pattern recognition
A mixed-type wafer defect pattern recognition approach with visual transformers

- Semiconductor manufacturing process 
Semiconductor manufacturing is a highly complex and precise process with numerous steps involved in creating integrated circuits on silicon wafers. Defects can occur at any stage of this process, from wafer fabrication to packaging. These defects can lead to yield loss and impact the performance of the final electronic devices. Manufacturers need to control the quality of semiconductor wafers to maintain high yields and reduce production costs.

Wafers defect pattern recognition (DPR) in semiconductor manufacturing in semiconductor manufacturing is an essential step to inspect the defect pattern that can occur during the production of semiconductor wafers. DPR is not only about defect detection but also about understanding the root causes of defects. Identifying the underlying reasons for defects helps in implementing corrective actions to prevent them from recurring.
